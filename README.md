# 🧠 Wireless Network Security Assessment (Home Lab)

**Created by:** Lakpa Sherpa  
**Date:** November 2025  

## 📋 Project Overview
Assessed a home Wi-Fi network and compared it to public networks. Identified security gaps, evaluated risks, and applied security controls following basic wireless security best practices.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Network was secured with **WPA2**, but **WPA3** was not enabled.
- **WPS** was turned on, exposing the network to brute-force PIN attacks.
- **Default router admin credentials** and **default SSID** were still in use.
- Public networks observed had **open authentication** and no encryption.

## 🛡️ Mitigation Steps
- Turned off **WPS** to reduce attack surface.
- Changed the **default admin password** to a strong passphrase.
- Renamed SSID to a **non-default, non-identifiable** name.
- Planned upgrade to **WPA3** for stronger encryption.

## ✅ Result
- Improved wireless network security posture and reduced risk of unauthorized access.
