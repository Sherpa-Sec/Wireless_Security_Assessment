## 📋 Project Overview
This project involved analyzing and assessing multiple wireless networks to identify security configurations, potential vulnerabilities, and improvement plans.

The assessment covered:
- Network discovery and SSID identification  
- Security type analysis (WPA2, WPA3, Open)  
- Router configuration review  
- Recommendations for securing home networks  

---

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **WPA2** was used — strong but less secure than WPA3.  
- **WPS enabled** — potential attack surface for brute-force attacks.  
- **Default admin password not changed** — high security risk.  
- **Default SSID in use** — makes the network easily identifiable.

---

## 🛡️ Recommendations
1. Disable WPS to prevent unauthorized access.  
2. Change the default admin password to a strong, unique one.  
3. Personalize the SSID to reduce exposure.  
4. Upgrade to **WPA3** if supported.  
5. Optionally hide the SSID for extra privacy.
