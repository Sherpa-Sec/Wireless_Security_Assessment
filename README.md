## 📋 Project Overview
This self-guided project replicates a wireless network assessment similar to what’s done in academic cybersecurity labs.  
I used my home lab environment to analyze Wi-Fi security settings, identify common vulnerabilities, and apply secure configuration practices.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **WPA2** security was in use — strong but could be improved by upgrading to **WPA3**.  
- **WPS** was enabled, which can be exploited by attackers.  
- **Default admin credentials** and SSID increased the attack surface.

## 🛡️ Mitigation Steps
1. Disabled WPS to reduce brute-force risk.  
2. Changed default admin password to a strong unique passphrase.  
3. Personalized the SSID to make it less predictable.  
4. Planned to upgrade to WPA3 for improved encryption.
